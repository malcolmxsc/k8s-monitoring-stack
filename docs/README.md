# Project Documentation

This directory collects the long-form documentation and operational runbooks for the observability sandbox. The goal is to keep the repository root tidy while still making it easy to discover the supporting material for the application and its demo environment.

## Structure

- [`runbooks/`](runbooks/) – Task-focused guides for operating the demo stack and troubleshooting common issues.
- (More sections can be added here as the project evolves.)

If you add new long-form documentation, place it in this folder and link it from the table above to keep things organized.
